# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with newcomers and helping them learn
* Sharing knowledge and expertise generously
* Giving credit where credit is due

### Restricted Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

  any kind

* Spamming or excessive promotional content
* Making assumptions about others' expertise based on demographics
* Sustained disruption of community discussions or events
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project-related activities, including but not limited to:
- GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Project communication channels (email, forums, chat)
- Project events and meetups
- Social media interactions related to the project

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by contacting the project team at:

All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

* Your contact information
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* A description of the behavior and your account of what happened
* The approximate time and location of the incident
* Any additional information that may be helpful

### What Happens After You File a Report

You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours.

The project team will:
1. Review the incident

3. Decide on appropriate action
4. Communicate decisions to relevant parties

We are committed to transparency while protecting the privacy and safety of
reporters and victims.

## Enforcement

Any instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be
reported to the project team at Thibaut.Vuillaume@softcom.pro Each complaint
will be carefully reviewed and investigated, resulting in an appropriate response
based on the specific circumstances. The project team maintains strict
confidentiality regarding incident reporters and handles all matters with
discretion. Additional enforcement procedures may be documented separately

may face consequences as determined by the project's leadership team.
